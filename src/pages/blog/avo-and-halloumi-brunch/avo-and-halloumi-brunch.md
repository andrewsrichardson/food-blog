title: Avo and Halloumi Brunch
description: "Now this is a Sunday kind of brunch. Creamy smashed avo topped
  with soft sizzled halloumi on a slice of toasted sourdough. How can you not
  LOVE?! It's quick, it's easy and it's so so so GOOD. Small pinch of chilli
  flakes and parsley level it up here too. "
time: "15"
ingredient:
  - item:
      itemtitle: Smashed Avo
      itemcomponents:
        - component: 2 avocados
        - component: Squeeze of lemon
        - component: Pinch of garlic granules
        - component: Splash of olive oil
        - component: 1 tsp chilli flakes
  - item:
      itemtitle: Halloumi and extras
      itemcomponents:
        - component: Half a block of halloumi, sliced into chunky strips
        - component: 3 slices of sourdough
        - component: Fresh parsley, finely chopped (optional)
method:
  - Chop your halloumi into chunky strips and pop into a cold frying pan with no
    oil. Whack that on a medium heat and pop your sourdough into the toaster
  - Cut the avo in half and scoop the goodness into a bowl and mash with a fork
    until smooth
  - Add in a splash of olive oil, a squeeze of lemon juice and garlic granules
    and stir until combined
  - After a few minutes, the halloumi should be bubbling so turn each one over
    and they should be lovely and browned and cook for another minute or two
  - CONSTRUCTION TIME. Get a heaped spoon of the smashed avo on to a slice of
    toasted sourdough. Sprinkle some chilli flakes on top and then layer the
    halloumi on top. I had some parsley in the fridge so added a sprinkle on top
    too. SORTED
  - Enjoy that brunch !!!
