      itemtitle: Baked Cod
      itemcomponents:
        - component: 1 cod loin
        - component: Handful of fresh parsley, finely chopped
        - component: 1 garlic clove, crushed
        - component: 1 tbsp olive oil
  - item:
      itemtitle: Risotto
      itemcomponents:
        - component: 1 leek, finely sliced
        - component: 3 garlic cloves, crushed
        - component: 80g arborio rice
        - component: 1 vegetable stock cube
        - component: Parmesan, finely grated
        - component: 100g frozen peas
method:
  - Mix the parsley and crushed garlic clove with the olive oil to create a
    paste. Season this well and spread over the top of the cod. Place in a
    preheated oven at 200C and leave to bake for 20 minutes
  - In a frying pan, saute the leeks in some olive oil until they are
    translucent and soft. Add in the garlic and rice and cook off for a few
    minutes
  - Make 600ml of boiling hot stock. Slowly add to the risotto rice. Add a bit
    at a time, let the rice soak it up and keep repeating this until the rice is
    cooked. It usually takes around 20 minutes of stirring and adding stock
  - Give it a taste test, if the rice is still a tad crunchy, add some more
    water and keep stirring.
  - Once cooked, add a few spoons into a bowl and take your cod out of the oven.
    Place the fish on top of the risotto rice. Serve with steamed green veggies,
    YUM
