  - Pop the peanut butter in a bowl and microwave for 30 seconds to loosen
    slightly. Add in all the other ingredients to the sauce and stir well. Add a
    teaspoon of warm water at a time to until it is a lovely dressing
    consistency
  - "Add in all the salad ingredients (except the garnishes) into a large bowl
    and stir well. Add the majority of the dressing and stir until it is
    thoroughly coated. "
  - Construction time - add the salad to your favourite bowl and scatter your
    delicious shredded chicken on top. Get the peanut sauce and drizzle it all
    over. Garnishes - spring onion, red chilli, coriander and dry roasted
    peanuts, big fat YES. Now enjoy !!
