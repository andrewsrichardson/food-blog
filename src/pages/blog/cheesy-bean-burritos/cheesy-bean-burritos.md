title: Cheesy Bean Burritos
description: >
  This burrito is a tex-mex classic guaranteed to sort you out. Filled with many
  veggies, the fluffiest seasoned rice and plenty of cheese!
time: "45"
ingredients:
  - Mexican Rice
  - 200g of brown rice
  - 100g of frozen peas
  - Vegetable stock cube
  - 1 tsp dried oregano
  - 1 tsp ground cumin
  - 1/2 tsp chilli flakes
  - 1/2 tsp smoked paprika
  - Burrito bean filling
  - 4 coloured peppers, sliced
  - 1 tin of kidney beans
  - 1 tin of cannellini beans
  - 1 white onion, sliced
  - 1 red onion, sliced
  - 5 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed
  - 2 tsp smoked paprika
  - 1 tsp cumin
  - 1 tsp oregano
  - 1/2 tsp paprika
  - Salsa
  - 12 cherry tomatoes, finely chopped
  - Half a red onion, finely chopped
  - Splash of lemon juice
  - 1 tsp oregano
  - Extras
  - 100g grated cheese of your choice (I love Red Leicester!)
  - Dollop of sour cream
  - 6 wraps
method:
  - Start by rinsing the brown rice to get rid of any excess starch and add some
    olive oil to a saucepan on a medium heat
  - Add in all the dry spices for the Mexican rice and let them toast, after a
    few minutes, add in your rice to the pan too and let it sizzle
  - Crumble in a vegetable stock cube to the rice and then add 400ml of boiling
    water, leave on a simmer with the lid on for 20 minutes
  - Meanwhile, in another frying pan, add some olive oil and once hot, add in
    both the sliced onions
  - Once translucent, add in the crushed garlic and it’ll be smelling delicious
    already
  - "After a few minutes of sizzling, add in your peppers along with all the
    dried spices including salt and pepper and let it cook off for 5 minutes "
  - Drain both tins of beans and add to the pan. Sometimes it can be a bit dry
    at this point and if that is the case, add a splash of olive oil and leave
    to cook for approximately 5 minutes
  - In a bowl, add all the salsa ingredients and season with plenty of salt and
    pepper and set aside
  - Now time to build the dish! Take a wrap, add a dollop of sour cream and a
    heaped spoon of rice down the middle. Add your Mexican bean filling, some
    salsa and grated cheese then fold over both ends and wrap it tightly. I love
    to toast it slightly just to get that crunch but that’s optional.
