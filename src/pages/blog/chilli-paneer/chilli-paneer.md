title: Chilli Paneer
description: A banging authentic Indo-Chinese style street food dish - crispy
  paneer and caramelised peppers and onions covered in a sweet and spicy
  marinade that is so easy to make up with things from the cupboard. Proper good
  stuff!
pro_tip: I know tomato ketchup is a bit rogue but trust me on this one! Make
  sure you let the sauce bubble and caramelise to get that deep flavour.
time: "30"

      itemcomponents:
        - component: 250g paneer, cubed (you should be able to find this in most big
            supermarkets)
        - component: 2 tbsp corn flour
        - component: Small cup of water
        - component: 1 tsp coriander powder

      itemtitle: Veggies
      itemcomponents:
        - component: 5 garlic cloves, crushed
        - component: 1cm ginger, finely chopped
        - component: 1 white onion, cut into big squares
        - component: "2 peppers (ideally 1 yellow and 1 red), "
        - component: 2 spring onions, finely sliced
        - component: Coriander, chopped, to serve
  - item:
      itemtitle: Sweet and Spicy Marinade
      itemcomponents:
        - component: 2 tbsp dark soy sauce
        - component: "1 tbsp sweet chilli sauce "
        - component: 2 tbsp tomato ketchup
method:
  - In a bowl, add a splash of water to the cornflour until it makes a thick
    batter. Add the coriander and cumin powder and season well then tip in the
    paneer and stir until it's fully coated
  - FRY TIME! I cooked my paneer in an air fryer for around 8 minutes on 180C
    and they came out so yummy and crispy. If you don't have an air fryer, you
    can sizzle in a frying pan with a little oil for around 5 minutes and they
    should turn out just as good
  - "Whilst the paneer is cooking, get some oil on a high heat in a wok and
    sizzle up the garlic and ginger until fragrant "
  - Add in the peppers and onions and let it cook off for about 5 minutes and
    then add in all the sweet and spicy sauce ingredients. Let it bubble and
    caramelise for another 5 minutes
  - Add in the paneer and give it a good stir and to serve, sprinkle the
    coriander and spring onion on top and there you go !! Delicious!
