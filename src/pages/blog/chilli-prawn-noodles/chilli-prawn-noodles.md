  - item:
      itemtitle: Prawn Noods
      itemcomponents:
        - component: 150g king prawns (I used fresh cooked ones but you can use frozen)
        - component: 1 red onion, thinly sliced
        - component: 1 red pepper, thinly sliced
        - component: "Handful of sugar snap peas "
        - component: Sprinkle of chilli flakes
        - component: 4 garlic cloves, crushed
        - component: 200g fine egg noodles
        - component: Half a lime, juiced
        - component: 2 spring onions, finely chopped
        - component: 2 tbsp soy sauce
        - component: 2 tbsp oyster sauce
        - component: Drizzle of chilli oil
method:
  - Get the onions, peppers and sugar snap peas sizzling in a splash of sesame
    oil in a wok on a high heat for a few minutes then add in the garlic and
    turn the heat down
  - In a separate saucepan, cook the noodles according to the packets
    instructions. I went for the classic dried egg noodle ones that only take
    about 4 minutes to cook
  - Add the oyster sauce and soy sauce to the veggies and add in the prawns.
    Stir thoroughly. Squeeze in the lime juice for the added zing and tip in the
    drained noodles
  - Leave it on a low heat and combine everything together nicely. Add a drizzle
    of chilli oil (you can vary the amount depending on how spicy you like it!)
    then you're good to go. Garnish with the classics - spring onion and black
    sesame seeds and FEAST
