method:
  - Get the diced onions sizzling in a deep frying pan with some olive oil until
    they turn translucent
  - "Once translucent, add in the crushed garlic and chipotle chilli paste and
    stir to get the onions all coated and spicy "
  - After a few minutes of cooking, add in your tinned tomatoes and stock cube
    and leave on a medium heat simmer for around 20 minutes stirring and adding
    splashes of water every 5 minutes or so
  - Whilst this is simmering away, get the chicken in a pan and brown, adding
    the paprika and plenty of salt and pepper
  - "Once almost cooked, take the chicken out and add the peppers and mushrooms
    to the same pan. Cook them for about 5 to 7 minutes on a medium heat with a
    splash of olive oil "
  - PASTA TIME - get your pasta on boil in a large pan of salty water and cook
    according to the instructions
  - Now to complete the sauce. Add your chicken and veggies back into the tomato
    sauce and pop down to a low heat. If the sauce seems a bit dry, add a splash
    of hot water to loosen. Add in the double cream and season well
  - To construct, pop your cooked pasta into the sauce and make sure you top
    with plenty of parsley and parmesan. YUM
