      itemcomponents:
        - component: 1 tsp butter
        - component: 2 eggs

  - Get the diced chorizo in a frying pan on a high heat. It should release some
    of the lovely fragrant oil and be sizzling. Cook for a few minutes until

    bowl and season well
  - Add the butter to the same frying pan and pop on a low heat. Once fully

    take a while but the result is the creamiest eggs
  - Pop your bagel in the toaster and keep stirring the eggs until they are
    creamy and cooked
  - Building the dish - spoon the creamy eggs on top of the buttered bagel and
    then sprinkle your crispy chorizo all over. Garnish with spring onions and
    parsley and there you have it - a boujee delicious brunch !!
