method:
  - As the start of most curries, get the onions sizzling in a glug of vegetable
    oil until they turn translucent and slightly brown. The slower and longer
    you cook this off, the deeper the taste will be
  - Add in your garlic, ginger and dry spices into the pan and let it cook off
    for around 5 minutes
  - Add in the tin of chopped tomatoes into the pan and leave on a medium heat
    stirring regularly for around 20 minutes. Season well with salt and pepper.
    You may need to add a few splashes of water throughout
  - Blender time. Retrieve the cinnamon stick from the curry base and blend the
    rest of the sauce until silky smooth. Add a splash of hot water as you do
    this
  - Get the smooth sauce back into a pan on low heat and stir in 2 tbsp of the
    double cream
  - Add in all your fillings - paneer, peas and spinach. Stir well and pop the
    lid on and cook for around 10 minutes.
  - Drizzle the remaining cream on top! Serve with naans and rice, delicious
