        - component: 1 tsp dried thyme
        - component: 150g chestnut mushrooms, sliced
        - component: 150g frozen peas
        - component: 2 tbsp cream cheese (I used a garlic and herb one)

      itemcomponents:
        - component: Fresh crusty bread
        - component: Freshly steamed brocolli
        - component: Flat leaf parsley, finely chopped
method:
  - Season the chicken thighs with salt and pepper and pop them in a frying pan
    with a glug of olive oil. Cook them on both sides for around 5 minutes so
    they browned. Remove from the pan
  - In the same pan, add in the leeks and garlic and saute for 5 minutes. Pop in
    the sliced mushrooms and cook down
  - "Add in the cream cheese and stir well. Pop in the frozen peas and let them
    simmer "
  - Whilst the pan is simmering, make up 300ml of hot chicken stock. Add a
    sprinkle of flour into the pan and mix well. This is to thicken the sauce
  - Now slowly add the stock into the pan stirring well. Place the chicken
    thighs back into the pan and pop a lid on it. Simmer for 15 minutes so it
    cooks perfectly
  - Garnish with fresh parsley and serve with fresh buttered crusty bread and a
    side of greens
