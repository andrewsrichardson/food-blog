      itemtitle: Pie Topping
      itemcomponents:
        - component: Filo pastry, 6 sheets
        - component: 1 tbsp olive oil
method:
  - Pop the cubed butternut in a roasting tray and season well. Pop into a
    preheated oven for around 35 minutes at 180C
  - In a large saucepan, add a glug of olive oil and saute the leeks until soft.
    Add in the cubed carrots and cook for around 5 minutes
  - Add in the crushed garlic and curry powder and stir until all the leeks are
    covered. Add in the turmeric and season well with salt and freshly cracked
    black pepper
  - "Stir in the plain flour and then slowly add in the stock to form a thick
    sauce. Add in the peas and spinach at this point and leave to simmer on a
    medium heat for 5 minutes. Stir in the double cream and add in the butternut
    squash once it's roasted "
  - Pour the pie filling into an ovenproof dish. For the topping, take a sheet
    of filo and scrunch it up and place it on top. Repeat this until the pie is
    covered. Mine took about 6 filo sheets but it will depend on how big your
    dish is. Brush over some olive oil on top of the pastry
  - Pop in a preheated oven for 30 minutes until golden brown and crispy. Serve
    with roast potatoes and green veggies
