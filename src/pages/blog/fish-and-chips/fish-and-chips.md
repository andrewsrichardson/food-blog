title: Fish and Chips
description: Arguably, one of the biggest British classics. Crispy cod, rosemary
  chips and a heap of minted smashed peas. What's not to love? This is a
  healthier lighter version of the popular pub grub dish but just as bloody
  delicious!
pro_tip: I love creating my own homemade breadcrumbs but if you don't have a
  food processor to whizz it up, you can buy readymade golden or panko
  breadcrumbs!
time: "60"
ingredient:
  - item:
      itemtitle: Crispy Cod
      itemcomponents:
        - component: 2 cod fillets
        - component: 3 slices of bread/thins (I used Warburton thins as they crisp up
            really well!)
        - component: 1 egg, whisked
        - component: 1 tbsp plain flour
        - component: 1 tsp garlic granules
        - component: 1 tsp paprika
  - item:
      itemtitle: Rosemary Chips
      itemcomponents:
        - component: 3-4 Maris Piper potatoes, cut into chips
        - component: 1.5 tsp rosemary
        - component: 1 tbsp olive oil
  - item:
      itemtitle: Smashed Peas
      itemcomponents:
        - component: 150g frozen peas
        - component: 1 tsp mint sauce
        - component: "Knob of butter "
method:
  - Preheat the oven to 200C. Place the cut up potatoes in a bowl of cold water
    and let them soak for around 10 minutes
  - To make delicious breadcrumbs, I love to use Warburton Thins for a low
    calorie crunchy coating. Whizz them up in a food processor and toast them in
    a frying pan on a low heat. Be careful, they can burn easily here so keep an
    eye on them until they are crunchy and dry (usually takes a few minutes)
  - "After 10 minutes, drain the chips and pat dry with a kitchen towel and get
    them on a baking tray. Add 1/2 tbsp of olive oil, the dried rosemary and
    plenty of salt and pepper and whack them into the oven for around 30 minutes
    turning half way "
  - Get your breadcrumbs on to a flat plate and add the garlic granules, paprika
    and plenty of salt and pepper and pat your cod fillets dry. Get the plain
    flour on a flat plate too. Production line time - dip the cod into the flour
    then egg and then into the breadcrumbs and get them coated fully
  - Next you want to sizzle the fish in a frying pan with a glug of olive oil so
    the breadcrumbs become crispy. Around 2 minutes on each side then straight
    into the hot oven for around 7-10 minutes so the cod becomes flaky and
    delicious
  - Whilst the fish and chips are finishing in the oven, boil your peas for
    around 5 minutes until they are cooked. Drain them and gently mash to create
    the smashed peas. To this, I add the mint sauce, parsley and butter and its
    done!
  - I like to serve all of this goodness with a big dollop of tartare sauce and
    a squeeze of lemon, big fat YES!
