      itemcomponents:
        - component: 200g of your favourite pasta shape

method:
  - Pop the pine nuts in a frying pan on a medium heat. Toast them for around 5
    minutes, make sure they don't burn
  - To make the pesto, whack all the ingredients into a small food processor and
    whizz until smooth. It should turn into a lovely glossy sauce
  - Pop the brocolli and tomatoes in a small baking dish and roast for 15
    minutes in an oven preheated at 200C. Season well with salt and pepper and
    add a glug of olive oil
  - While the veggies are roasting, get your pasta on to boil. Once cooked,
    drain the pasta, add in the pesto and veggies and stir well so it's all
    coated. Rip up some mozzarella all over the top and a final crack of black
    pepper. Delish
