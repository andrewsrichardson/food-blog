title: Indian Spiced Aubergine
description: Pan fried crispy aubergine discs in a spicy masala marinade.
  Absolutely ideal as a simple yet delicious starter or side dish in an Indian
  feast.
pro_tip: Ensure you don't stack the aubergine discs in the pan, only do one
  layer at a time to ensure they get that golden crispy coating.
time: "15"
ingredients:
  - 1 large aubergine
  - 2 tbsp vegetable oil
  - 4 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed
  - 3 cm ginger, grated
  - 3/4 tsp cumin powder
  - 3/4 tsp coriander powder
  - 1/2 tsp turmeric
  - 1/2 tsp chilli powder
  - 3/4 tsp salt
  - Coriander (to garnish)
method:
  - Start by slicing the aubergines into 1.5cm thick discs and leave aside
  - In a large bowl, add the oil, garlic, ginger and all dry spices and mix
    together to create a marinade
  - Dip each disc into the masala marinade so it is totally covered then leave
    aside. Complete this with all of the aubergine
  - Get a frying pan on a moderate heat with a bit of vegetable oil and once
    hot, start to add the aubergine in, just one layer at a time. It should be
    sizzling
  - Let it cook for two minutes and then flip over and cook for a further two
    minutes. They should be golden brown and caramelised
  - Pop the pan on a low heat and add a lid so it can steam slightly to ensure
    its fully cooked then its ready to serve with a garnish of coriander
