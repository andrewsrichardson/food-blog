  curried chicken and potato traybake EVER. Absolutely ideal for a Friday night
  munch to hit all the spots accompanied with a cold beverage and naans
pro_tip: The longer you leave it to marinate, the tastier it'll be! Feel free to
  double the ingredients if you are cooking for more people

        - component: 1 inch ginger
        - component: 1 green chilli (optional)
        - component: 1 tsp cumin powder
        - component: 1 tsp coriander powder
        - component: 1/2 tsp garam masala
        - component: 1/2 tsp turmeric
        - component: 1 tsp red chilli powder

      itemtitle: Extras
      itemcomponents:
        - component: 3 white potatoes, sliced thinly
        - component: Fresh coriander, finely chopped
method:
  - In a food processor, whizz up the garlic, ginger and chilli until finely
    chopped. Then add in the onion, 1 tbsp vegetable oil along with all the dry
    spices and blend
  - Once this is all combined, add in the fresh tomatoes and puree and pulse
    until it is a smooth consistency
  - Remove the skin from the chicken and score slightly so the flavours can
    penetrate. Get the chicken and sliced potatoes in a baking dish and pour the
    marinade all over the chicken and stir so it is totally covered. Leave to
    marinate for an hour at least
  - >-
    Cover the baking dish tightly with foil and pop in a preheated oven at 180C
    for 30 minutes. After this, take off the foil and continue cooking for a
    further 10 minutes.

    Garnish with coriander and serve with rice and naans - delicious !
