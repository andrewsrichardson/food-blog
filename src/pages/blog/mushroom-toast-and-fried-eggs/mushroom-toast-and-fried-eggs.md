title: Mushroom Toast and Fried Eggs
description: Saut√©ed garlic cheesy mushrooms topped with runny fried eggs make a
  glorious brunch when you need something hassle-free but delicious
pro_tip: Don't stir the mushrooms too much when they first start sizzling, let
  them do their thing so they go lovely and caramelised
time: "10"
ingredient:
  - item:
      itemtitle: Shrooms and eggs
      itemcomponents:
        - component: 150g of chestnut mushrooms (around half a pack), sliced
        - component: 1 tsp garlic puree
        - component: 2 large eggs
        - component: 25g red leicester cheese, grated
  - item:
      itemtitle: Extras
      itemcomponents:
        - component: Sourdough bread, toasted
        - component: 1 tsp parsley, to serve
        - component: "pinch of chilli flakes, to serve "
method:
  - "In a large non-stick frying pan, add a splash of olive oil and begin frying
    the chopped mushrooms for around 5 minutes "
  - Then add in your garlic and plenty of salt and pepper and move to one side
    of the pan
  - At this point, get your sourdough in the toaster. I know sourdough is a bit
    fancy but honestly, for this brunch, it seriously levels up the brunch game
  - Add your cheese on top of the mushrooms and let it start to melt
  - Then crack your two eggs into the other side of the pan on a medium heat and
    let them sizzle. I like to flip them over for legit 30 seconds once they are
    done to create the optimal runny egg
  - To serve, slide the cheesy mushrooms on the buttered toast and top with your
    eggs and a sprinkle of parsley and chilli flakes
