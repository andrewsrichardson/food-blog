title: Perfect Scrambled Eggs
description: "The softest creamiest buttery scrambled eggs on top of a toasted
  ciabatta roll. A perfect fool proof breakfast that will start your day off
  right. "
pro_tip: The key is cooking the eggs low and slow to get them as creamy as possible.
ingredients:
  - A knob of butter
  - 3 eggs
  - 1 tsp parsley
  - Ciabatta roll
method:
  - Crack your eggs into a bowl, season with plenty of salt and black pepper
    then whisk fast for a minute or so
  - Get a non-stick frying pan on a low heat and add in the butter so it melts
    and coats the pan
  - Meanwhile, pop the ciabatta rolls under the grill to let them crunch up
  - Add in your eggs, keeping the pan on a low heat and begin to stir with a
    wooden spoon
  - Keep stirring until it starts to look silky and come together then take it
    off a minute or so before they look done as they will keep cooking in the
    hot pan
  - "Butter your toasted rolls and gently slide the eggs on top "
  - Garnish with the parsley and a touch more black pepper and you're good to go!
