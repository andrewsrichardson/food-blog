title: Prawn, Leek and Pea Risotto
description: "An easy creamy one pan wonder. A rich risotto full of veggies and
  prawns that requires a little time and love for the most glorious end product.
  Perfect served with a side of steamed broccoli. "
pro_tip: It is a bit tedious stirring the risotto for a little while but it is
  so so worth it!
time: "45"
ingredient:
  - item:
      itemtitle: Risotto
      itemcomponents:
        - component: 1 red onion, diced
        - component: 2 leeks, sliced
        - component: 4 garlic cloves, crushed
        - component: 200g risotto rice (I used Arborio rice)
        - component: 1 chicken or vegetable stock cube
        - component: 150g frozen peas
        - component: 150g cooked prawns
  - item:
      itemtitle: Extras
      itemcomponents:
        - component: Knob of butter
        - component: 1 tsp dried parsley
        - component: "Parmesan cheese, to serve "
method:
  - Get the red onion and leeks sizzling in a deep frying pan with a glug of
    olive oil
  - After 5 minutes of softening, add in your garlic and let that cook off for a
    few minutes
  - Then pop in your rice and toast for a few minutes and in the meantime, boil
    the kettle and create 500ml of stock
  - Now the slightly tedious task (I promise its worth it for the creamiest of
    risottos as the end product!!).. Slowly add the stock a ladle at a time to
    the rice and stir until absorbed. Repeat this until all the stock has been
    used
  - After about 20 mins, add in your peas and continue stirring for a further 10
    minutes. Season well at this point
  - Taste test to see if the rice is soft and luscious.. If its still crunchy,
    add another 200ml of stock slowly (the time cooking depends on the type of
    rice you have so don't worry if it takes a bit longer!)
  - When the rice is almost done, it should be thick, creamy and should have
    soaked up all of the stock. At this point, pop in your prawns. I used to
    pre-cooked ones so add them right at the end to ensure they don't overcook
    but if you have raw ones, then add them in with the peas
  - Add a knob of butter and pop the lid on for the last few minutes for that
    extra richness
  - To serve, top with parmesan, parsley and freshly cracked black pepper and a
    side of steamed broccoli. Delicious !!
