method:
  - Pop all the chicken thigh marinade ingredients into a bowl and mix well.
    Massage into the thighs and set aside for 10 minutes
  - Get your roasties on the go.. See my recipe for Ultimate Roast Potatoes for
    the best crispiest roasties
  - In a frying pan, get a splash of olive oil heating up. Place the chicken
    thighs in once hot and sizzle on both sides for 3 minutes
  - Set aside in a baking dish and pop in the preheated oven at 200C for 30
    minutes to cook all the way through
  - Lay the green veggies on a tray and season well with salt and pepper. Pop in
    the oven for around 15 minutes
  - Once the chicken is cooked, take it out of the baking dish and pop on to a
    medium heat hob. There should be lots of goodness in the dish so add in the
    flour and whisk to make a roux
  - Slowly add the stock and continue stirring to make a thick gravy. Strain
    through a sieve and you should get a silky smooth simple gravy on the other
    end
  - Building the dish.. Get the chicken, roasties and veggies in a plate and
    pour over that silky gravy. YUM
