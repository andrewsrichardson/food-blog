title: Salmon and Spinach Curry
description: A homestyle favourite of mine. It's saucy, it's rich and it's
  delicious. Absolutely perfect served with buttery rice and mini naans! Ideal
  for satisfying those takeaway cravings.
pro_tip: The sauce does need some time and patience to allow it to cook off but
  it will be worth it - I promise!

      itemcomponents:
        - component: Basmati rice
        - component: Mini naans
        - component: Coriander, to garnish
method:
  - Peel the skin of the salmon fillets and cut into roughly 3cm chunks and pop
    into a bowl
  - "In a food processor, add all the other salmon marinade ingredients and
    whizz up then pour over the chopped salmon and set aside for about 15
    minutes "
  - In a deep frying pan or saucepan, get the onions sizzling with a cinnamon
    stick until they turn soft and slightly browned
  - "Then add in your garlic, ginger and all dry spices for the curry base and
    stir. It should be smelling gloriously fragrant right about now "
  - "After a few minutes of cooking off, pop in the tinned tomatoes and leave on
    a medium heat to bubble away "
  - Now time to cook the salmon. In a separate pan, sizzle the fish in a little
    bit of oil. It'll need a few minutes on each side and don't worry if its not
    fully cooked
  - Keep stirring the curry base and adding splashes of water as you go. Simmer
    for around 25 minutes and then add in your spinach and stir. Add in your
    salmon pieces but don't stir too much as we don't want the salmon to
    crumble. Leave on a low heat for a further 5-7 minutes
  - "YUM!! Finally, garnish with some coriander and you're sorted! I served mine
    with some buttery basmati rice and mini naans and it was DELICIOUS. "
