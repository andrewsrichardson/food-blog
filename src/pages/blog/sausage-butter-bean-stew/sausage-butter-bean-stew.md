title: Sausage and Butter Bean Stew
description: A rich spicy tomato stew filled with caramelised sausages, melt in
  the mouth butter beans and peppers. Served perfectly with some cheesy garlic
  bread to mop up the sauce !
pro_tip: I used vegan sausages - specifically the Aldi butternut squash and red
  pepper ones but feel free to use whichever you like !

        - component: 1 tsp smoked paprika

      itemtitle: Cheesy Garlic Bread
      itemcomponents:
        - component: 1 small baguette
        - component: 2 tbsp butter/margarine
        - component: 2 garlic cloves
        - component: Sprinkle of parsley
        - component: "Handful of your favourite cheese (I used mozzarella) "
method:
  - Get the onions sizzling in olive oil in a pan until they are translucent.
    Add in the garlic, smoked paprika and peppers and cook on a medium heat for
    10 minutes
  - Tip in the tinned tomatoes along with a crushed stock cube and bring to the
    boil. Once it's bubbling, add in the chilli flakes and let it simmer on a
    low heat for around 25 minutes stirring regularly. Season well at this point
  - Cook your sausages according to packet instructions. I air-fried the vegan
    ones I used so they went lovely and crispy
  - Add in the butter beans into the stew and cook for another 5 minutes
  - Create little cuts in the baguette but keep it held together. Add the
    butter, garlic and parsley in a bowl and mix well
  - Add the garlic butter in between the bread indents and wrap the baguette in
    foil and place in an oven preheated at 200C for 7 minutes
  - After 7 minutes, take the foil off and sprinkle cheese on top and pop back
    in the oven to allow the cheese to melt
  - You're good to go! Serve the stew with the garlic bread and enjoy!!
