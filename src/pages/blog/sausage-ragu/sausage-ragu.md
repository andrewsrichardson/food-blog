        - component: Pasta, to serve
        - component: Fresh basil, to garnish
method:
  - Get the onions sauteed in a deep frying pan with a glug of olive oil. Cook
    them off for a few minutes until they are translucent and soft
  - "Add in the chopped garlic and paprika and cook off for two minutes "
  - Tip in the rest of the veg - celery, red pepper, courgette and mushrooms and
    leave to sizzle for 10 minutes on a low-medium heat
  - Add in your chopped tomatoes and stir. Fill the empty tin with boiling water
    and add that to the pan along with a crumbled stock cube. Season well and
    add in your chilli flakes (you can alter the amount depending on how much
    you enjoy SPICE)
  - Leave the hob on a medium heat and let it simmer. The key here is the more
    time, the better. The longer you leave it bubbling, the deeper and richer
    the ragu willl be. Figure out what works with your timings but I left mine
    simmering for around 1 hour and 15 minutes. Make sure you stir every now and
    then and season well
  - For the sausages, you want to take out the meat from the skin. To do this, I
    slit it vertically with a knife and peel away the skin. Set aside the meat
    in a bowl
  - In a seperate pan, add the sausage meat with some olive oil on a medium
    heat. Using a wooden spoon, you want to break it down so it turns into a
    mince like consistency. You want to get it browned and slightly caramelised
    for a deeper flavour. Once cooked, add this to the sauce
  - Cook off for a few minutes so it is all combined and you're sorted. Garnish
    with fresh basil. I served this ragu with some pasta and it was so delicious
