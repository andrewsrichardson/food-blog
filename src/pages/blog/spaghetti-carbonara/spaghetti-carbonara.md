      itemtitle: Spaghetti Carbonara
      itemcomponents:
        - component: 4 rashers of streaky bacon or a handful of diced pancetta
        - component: "1 garlic clove, finely chopped "
        - component: "3 eggs "
        - component: "35g parmesan cheese, grated "
        - component: 200g dried spaghetti
        - component: Sprinkle of parsley, to garnish
method:
  - Get the bacon or pancetta sizzling in a glug of olive oil in a frying pan.
    Cook for around 5 minutes on a medium heat until it goes crispy and
    delicious
  - Add in the garlic clove to the pan too so that cooks up. Turn the heat down
    a smidge so it doesn't burn. Cook for around 2 minutes then set aside
  - Crack 2 of the eggs into a bowl and whisk together. For the final egg, we
    only want to use the yolk for extra creamy goodness so separate it and whisk
    it in. Tip in the parmesan cheese and lots of black pepper and stir so it
    creates a thick eggy mixture
  - Get the pasta in some boiling water and cook according to the packet
    instructions. Ensure this water is heavily salted. Once the pasta is almost
    cooked (usually around 9-10 minutes), add a ladle or two of the pasta water
    into a mug and leave for later
  - Drain the pasta and add it to the frying pan with the crispy bacon and
    garlic. Stir well so the flavourful oil coats the spaghetti. Now ensure this
    stays off the heat as you don't want to scramble the eggs but slowly add
    some eggy mixture and leftover pasta water a bit at a time stirring well.
    Keep doing this until the pasta is creamy and delicious. Keep stirring and
    it'll go delicious and glossy
  - "To serve, pop the spaghetti onto a plate and garnish with lots of black
    pepper, extra parmesan cheese and a sprinkle of parsley and voila ! "
