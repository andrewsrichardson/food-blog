title: Spicy Cod Noodle Broth
description: A spicy warming soup filled with colourful veggies and soft egg
  noodles topped with a flaky piece of cod covered in spring onions, sesame
  seeds and a drizzle of chilli oil. Unreal
pro_tip: I like to keep the cod pretty simple in this recipe, just pan fried to
  perfection then placed on top of a warming soup
time: "30"

      itemtitle: Noodle Broth
      itemcomponents:
        - component: 1 small red onion, finely sliced
        - component: 1 red pepper, finely sliced
        - component: 5 mushrooms, finely sliced
        - component: "A handful of florets of brocolli "
        - component: 4 garlic cloves, crushed
        - component: 2 portions of egg noodles
        - component: "1 stock cube "
        - component: 1tsp oyster sauce
        - component: 1tbsp soy sauce
        - component: 1tsp teriyaki sauce
method:
  - "In a frying pan on a medium heat, sizzle up the onions in a splash of
    vegetable oil and add the garlic and cook until translucent and fragrant. "
  - "Add in all the veggies and saute for around 10 minutes on a low heat until
    they are soft and delicious. Add a splash of soy sauce in too then set aside
    "
  - In a large saucepan, get 800ml of boiling water on the heat and crumble in a
    stock cube. Add in your noodles and cook according to the packet
    instructions (it's usually only 5 mins or less!). Add all the sauces into
    the broth and stir well and tip the veggies back in
  - In a frying pan, heat up the sesame oil and place the cod in the pan. Cook
    it for a few minutes on each side until it is flaky, adding a splash of soy
    sauce and popping the lid on so it can sizzle and steam in the last minute
    or so
  - To serve, pour the veggie noodle broth into large bowls. Place the cod right
    on top and garnish with sesame seeds and spring onions. Then add a drizzle
    of chilli oil on top to give it that last bit of ooomph. Enjoy !
