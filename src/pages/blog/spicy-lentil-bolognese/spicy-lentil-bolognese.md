title: Spicy Lentil Bolognese
description: A meat free alternative to a classic that will really hit the spot.
  The lentils give a hearty texture to the bolognese and it's perfect served
  with plenty of parmesan and garlic bread
pro_tip: I chose to use the pre cooked lentil bags just for ease! I got mine in
  Aldi but think you can pick them up in most supermarkets.

      itemtitle: Pasta n extras
      itemcomponents:
        - component: 300g dried spaghetti
        - component: Grated parmesan, to serve
method:
  - First, get the diced onions and garlic sizzling in a deep frying pan with a
    glug of olive oil
  - To ensure the veg is finely chopped, add the carrots, celery and mushrooms
    into a food processor for ease. Pop that in with the onions and fry off for
    around 5 minutes and then add both oregano and thyme to get in those
    flavours. If you don't have a food processor, just chop them really finely
  - Once softened, pop in the tin of chopped tomatoes and the tomato puree to
    start constructing the sauce. Crumble in the stock cube into the pan too and
    then fill the empty tin with boiling water and pop that in along with the
    chilli flakes. Give it a nice stir and let it simmer for 30 to 40 mins on a
    medium heat, occasionally stirring.
  - Add in the precooked lentils for the last 5 minutes of cooking so they don't
    get too mushed, we want them to keep their chunky texture
  - Cook the pasta according to its instructions and add a ladle of starchy
    pasta water into the sauce to thicken it up a tad
  - The sauce should now be hearty, thick and almost have a mince like texture.
    To serve, get a big pasta bowl, swirl in your spaghetti, a big dollop of the
    sauce and a mountain of parmesan. Big fat yum, this one is a winner
  - This recipe makes a big old portion so I like to freeze it to save for a
    rainy day when you need a winter warmer
