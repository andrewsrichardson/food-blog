      itemcomponents:
        - component: 1 leek, sliced
        - component: 4 garlic cloves, crushed
        - component: 2 vegetable stock cubes, dissolved in 600ml boiling water

method:
  - In a baking dish, add your squash, sage and rosemary along with a splash of
    olive oil. Season well and pop in a preheated oven at 180C for around 30
    minutes, until soft and slightly browned
  - In a frying pan, saute the leeks in olive oil for a few minutes until soft
    and add in the garlic. Sizzle for a further few minutes
  - Pop the rice into the pan and toast for a few minutes. Boil the kettle and
    create the hot stock
  - "Now you want to slowly add in your stock whilst stirring on a medium heat.
    This does take a little bit of time but it is definitely worth it. Add it in
    a ladle at a time letting the rice soak it up as you stir it. It should take
    around 25 minutes "
  - Once the squash is soft and yummy, add it into the risotto. Add in the
    parsley and season well
