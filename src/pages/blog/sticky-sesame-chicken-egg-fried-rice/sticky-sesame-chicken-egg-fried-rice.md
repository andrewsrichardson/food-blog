      itemtitle: Egg Fried Rice
      itemcomponents:
        - component: 250g cooked rice - preferably basmati (I used a tilda microwavable
            bag)
        - component: 2 garlic cloves, crushed
        - component: 1 egg
        - component: 1 tbsp dark soy sauce
        - component: 2 spring onions, sliced
method:
  - Chicken first. Add the garlic granules, salt and pepper into the cornflour
    in a small bowl and whisk the egg in a separate one. Dip each piece of
    chicken into the egg then into the cornflour and leave on a plate. Repeat
    until all chicken pieces are coated
  - Get a frying pan on a medium heat with a splash of olive oil. Sizzle each
    piece of chicken for 3 minutes on each side until the batter goes slightly
    crispy and then set aside
  - Mix all the wet ingredients for the chicken into a bowl and add in the
    crushed garlic. Pop this into a frying pan on a medium heat and let it
    bubble up so it goes sticky and thick
  - Add the chicken back in and stir so it is totally coated and sprinkle on the
    sesame seeds. Leave on a low heat
  - Now rice time! Add a splash of sesame oil into a frying pan and get the
    crushed garlic in and cook off for a few minutes
  - Pop in you rice and fry off for a few minutes and then make a well in the
    centre. Add in the egg to the middle and start scrambling it. Slowly
    incorporate the rice in the middle and then stir well
