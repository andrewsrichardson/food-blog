      itemtitle: Spicy Rice
      itemcomponents:
        - component: 150g basmati rice
        - component: 1 white onion, finely chopped
        - component: 3 garlic cloves, crushed
        - component: 2cm ginger, finely chopped
        - component: 1tsp cumin powder
        - component: 1 tsp coriander powder
        - component: 1 tsp turmeric
        - component: 1 chicken stock cube
        - component: 1 red pepper, diced
        - component: 100g frozen peas
        - component: 1 white potato, chopped into small cubes
method:
  - Mix the yogurt and all spices together to form a marinade and pour over the
    thinly sliced chicken breasts. Leave to marinate for around 30 minutes
  - In a non stick saucepan, fry the onions in a glug of vegetable oil until
    soft and translucent. Add in the garlic, ginger and dry spices and mix well
  - Tip in the red pepper and diced potatoes and fry it off with the onions and
    spices for around 5 minutes then add in the washed rice and sizzle for a few
    more minutes
  - "Crumble in the stock cube and add boiling water until it covers the rice by
    around 1 inch. Leave to simmer on a low heat for 10 minutes, ensuring you
    keep adding more water when it gets dry. At around the 13 minute mark, give
    the rice a taste to see if its cooked. If yes, then turn off the heat and
    pop the lid on to give it an extra steam "
  - I quite like sticky rice but if you prefer to more cooked, ensure all the
    water is evaporated. In a separate frying pan, add a glug of olive oil and
    fry up the chicken for 4 minutes on each side. It should be looking and
    smelling delicious
  - Time to construct the bowl! Add in the rice and the chicken and a green
    veggie of your choice, I of course went for broccoli! Add a minty yogurt
    drizzle and plenty of freshly chopped coriander and you're good to go
