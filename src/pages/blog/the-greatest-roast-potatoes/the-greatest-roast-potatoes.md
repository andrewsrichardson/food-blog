title: The Greatest Roast Potatoes
description: One of the most important parts of a Christmas dinner - crispy
  fluffy goodness!! But these roasties are perfect all year round, accompanying
  roasts, stews and pies!! The rosemary is an absolute winner here.
pro_tip: Don't rush it! They need some good time in the oven to get that CRISP
time: "120"
ingredient:

      itemtitle: Roast Potatoes
method:
  - Preheat the oven to 200C and get a large saucepan on the heat with some
    boiling water and season generously with salt
  - Add in your potatoes and par-boil them for about 10-12 minutes, you want
    them pretty much cooked but not falling apart
  - In your roasting tin, pour a few tablespoons of olive oil, add in some whole
    garlic cloves and your sprigs of rosemary and get it into a hot oven to warm
    up. Season this oil well - A LOT of salt and black pepper
  - Once the potatoes are done, drain them and shake them up in the colander so
    they get fluffy (this will create that extra CRISPINESS). Leave them to air
    dry for a few minutes
  - Sprinkle over some plain flour and toss up the potatoes
  - Carefully take out the dish with the hot oil in from the oven and add in
    your potatoes. Careful as the oil will be piping hot so do this with care,
    it might splash!
  - Pop it straight back in the oven and cook for around 45 minutes shaking up
    every now and then. They may need slightly longer depending on how big your
    potatoes are chopped
  - There we go!! Crunchy and crispy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the
    inside, how can you not love that?!
