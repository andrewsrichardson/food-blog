method:
  - Sizzle up the onions and garlic in a frying pan with a little olive oil
    until translucent and smelling delicious

    are slightly softened and then add in the mushrooms and kidney beans and let
    it sizzle for a further few minutes
  - SEASONING TIME – add in your paprika, oregano, dried cumin, coriander, salt,
    pepper and chilli flakes and stir and smell all the goodness
  - Leave on a low heat for around 5 minutes to let the spices cook off
  - To make a super simple guac – to some mashed avocado, add a finely diced red
    onion, a splash of olive oil, plenty of black pepper, a pinch of salt and
    chilli flakes and a dash of lemon juice and tadah! Hassle free Mexican GUAC
  - To construct the quesadillas, you want to lay a wrap on a plate and fill
    half of it with your Mexican spicy filling and then top with a generous
    handful of grated cheese and you then want to fold the wrap over creating a
    semi-circle
  - Add a spray of olive oil to your frying pan and add the semi circle
    quesadillas to the pan and cook on a medium heat for a few minutes until
    golden brown the flip. Cook the other side and they are done!
  - Serve with your homemade guac, some sour cream and a tasty side salad
