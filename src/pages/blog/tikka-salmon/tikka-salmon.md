        - component: 4 garlic cloves, crushed
        - component: 2cm ginger, finely chopped
        - component: 1 tsp coriander powder
        - component: 1 tsp cumin powder
        - component: 1/2 tsp turmeric

      itemtitle: Mint Chutney
      itemcomponents:
        - component: 2 tbsp greek yogurt
        - component: 1 tsp mint sauce
        - component: Half a red onion, finely chopped
method:
  - Add the garlic, ginger and all the dry spices to the yogurt and stir
    thoroughly. Tip in your chopped salmon and leave to marinate for as long as
    you can (anything from 15 minutes to a few hours)
  - "To make the mint chutney, add all those ingredients into a small bowl, mix
    well and season with salt and pepper "
  - To cook the salmon, get a frying pan with a splash of vegetable oil on a
    medium heat. Gently place each salmon piece into the pan and cook off on
    each side for around 5 minutes. Dont worry if they get a bit charred, we
    want some colour on it for flavour and aesthetic !
  - Once complete, place the salmon in a bowl, drizzle the mint sauce on top and
    sprinkle some coriander for that final garnish and serve with whatever takes
    your fancy
