method:
  - Firstly preheat the oven to 210C. To make the batter, sift the flour into a
    large bowl and add some salt and pepper. Make a well in the centre and crack
    the eggs into the middle and whisk. Once combined, pour in the milk a bit at
    a time and keep whisking. Make sure its smooth and lump free ! Cover with
    cling film and set aside until we need it
  - Get the oil into a big dish and add the sausages and pop in the oven and
    cook for 5-10 minutes until brown
  - Whilst the sausages a cooking, saut√© the leeks in a frying pan and season
    with salt and pepper until they are soft and then turn off the heat
  - Make the stuffing balls following the packet instructions
  - Add the leeks and balls into the dish with the sausages and distribute
    evenly. Add another tablespoon of oil as this is what makes the batter RISE.
    Pop back in the oven for a few minutes to get the oil hot and sizzling
  - "Carefully take the dish out of the oven and pour the batter in. It may
    splatter a little so please be careful. Once you have poured all the batter
    in, whack it straight into the oven for 25-30 mins (Do not open the oven
    door in this time else all you're hard work will be wasted!) "
  - After 30 minutes, slide a knife into the centre of the yorkshire pud - if it
    comes out clean, the batter is all cooked and you're good to go. If its
    still a little raw, just whack it in for a bit more cooking
  - Once cooked, cut into even squares for all your guests and you can serve it
    with whatever you like - roasties, mash, all types of veggies but most
    importantly, GRAVY. Enjoy !!
