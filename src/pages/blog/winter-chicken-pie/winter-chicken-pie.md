      itemtitle: Pie Top
      itemcomponents:
        - component: 1 roll of ready made puff pastry
        - component: 1 egg, whisked
method:
  - Preheat the oven to 200C. Fry the thigh pieces and bacon in some olive oil
    until the chicken is browned and the bacon is crispy and season with salt
    and pepper. Set aside in a bowl
  - In the same pan, saute the leeks in some olive oil for 5 minutes until
    softened and add in the thyme and garlic - it should be smelling hella
    fragrant now
  - Cook off the herbs and tip in your mushrooms and carrots and cook off for 7
    minutes. Add a splash of olive oil if it feels a bit dry. Add the chicken
    and bacon back it and season well
  - Sprinkle the plain flour into the pan and stir so it is completely coated.
    Then slowly add in the chicken stock whilst stirring. Add in your frozen
    peas at this point too. Once its all added, turn the heat up so it bubbles
    up nicely
  - Drizzle in the cream, add the parsley and stir well. Leave on a low heat for
    a few minutes and then pour into a ceramic baking dish
  - Roll the puff pastry over the top of the dish and pinch it around the
    corners so it's sealed well. Cut a little hole in the centre so the steam
    can escape and brush the egg all over
  - "Place into the hot oven and cook for 25-30 minutes until the pastry is
    golden brown - it is a BEAUTY. "
